# HADI: Kotlin HornsApp Dependency Injection
Hadi is a whole Kotlin container, which you can use very simple on JVM or Android.
You can define all the instance that you will need in your app and manage them in a single place.

## Getting Started
In your app gradle, you should add the repository:
 ```kotlin
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
 ```
 and the dependency:
 ```kotlin
 implementation 'com.github.Yesferal:HornsApp-DI:1.1.1'
 ```

Then, you should instance Hadi Container in your main class, so any class could access it without any problem.

```kotlin
val container: Container = Hadi()
```

### Android
In case of Android, you should create an instance of Hadi in your Application class.

 ```kotlin
 class MyApp: Application() {
     val container: Container = Hadi()
 }
 ```

 So, you can use it in any Activity:

 ```kotlin
 val container = (application as MyApp).container
```

## How to use: Register a simple dependency
 Some times the code is better than words, to register any dependency you just need:

 ```kotlin
 container register Factory<String> { "Message: Hadi Container is our first option !" }

 container register Singleton<MainRepository> {
    MainRepository(message = container.resolve())
 }

 class MainRepository(private val message: String) {
    fun getMessage() = message
 }
 ```

 ## How to use: Resolve dependency without Tag
 To resolve any dependency you just need:

 ```kotlin
 private val mainRepository: MainRepository = container.resolve()
 ```

 ## How to use: Register dependency using Tag
 To register a dependency using a Tag you just need to define the tag as a string. You can use this feature if you have dependencies that implement the same class, for example String:
 ```kotlin
 container register Factory<String>(tag = "Title") { "Title: Hadi Container" }
 container register Factory<String>(tag = "Description") { "Description: This is a demo app, which implement Hadi Container. This strings are injected by Hadi using a Tag, in order to Kadi know which one to use in each case." }

 container register Singleton<MainRepository> {
     MainRepository(
         message = container.resolve(tag = "Title"),
         description = container.resolve(tag = "Description")
     )
 }

 container register Factory<MainContract.ActionListener> {
     MainPresenter(mainRepository = container.resolve())
 }
 ```

 ## How to use: Resolve dependency using Tag
 To resolve a dependency using a Tag you just need to specify the tag that you used to register it:
 ```kotlin
 val message: String = container.resolve(tag = "Title")
 val description: String = container.resolve(tag = "Description")
 ```

 ## How to use: Register dependency with Parameters
 To register a dependency with parameters you just need to define the parameter structure as `name: Type`.
 You can use this feature if you have dependencies that need some parameters obtained at runtime:
 ```kotlin
 container register Factory(tag = "Parameter") { (string: String) ->
     string
 }
 ```

 ## How to use: Resolve dependency with parameters
 To resolve a dependency with parameters you just need to specify them inside the `Parameters`'s constructor:
 ```kotlin
 val description: String = container.resolve(params = Parameters("Description: Inserting value as Parameter"))
 ```

 Now you're ready to include & use Hadi library into your project!

 ## Demo Projects
 In this Repository you have an Android Demo that explain how to use it.
